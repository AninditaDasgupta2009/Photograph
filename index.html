I can draw my imagination and show others. I also draw to make greeting card and cards for my mother. It looks very pretty as I made this with my hands. I also love to make some cartoon drawings like pokemon. I have drawn many. And when ever I see it it makes me very happy. Drawing is amazing. With colors it looks very pretty and realistic. But I love sketching. I have graphite pencils. I have drawn many pictures of girls wearing hat or cap, many dresses and many more. But my most favourit is pokemon drawing. It's just amazing.  </p>
